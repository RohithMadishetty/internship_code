      <p> Hi, I'm Rohith Madishetty. A student at Texas Tech University pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science. During the internship, I want to improve myself in communication, personality development, time management, and discipline. Since I already have work experience in this field, I feel the mentioned things are equally important along with software development. And I want to improve my technical skills, coding skills that will help the organization and in turn myself.p>
      <p> I have done my Bachelor's in Computer Science, had work experience in the same field. I have worked as Data Engineer and Full Stack Developer in Java. The reason why I chose to a Software Engineer is that I love software development, it is always adapting, challenging. From my previous work experience, I have improved myself a lot in the UI part, Controller part. I have done development in Agile methodology where I used to get different tasks for every iteration, and they are challenging and interesting.</p>
      <p> I want to build software like a banking application where the website or application UI is user-friendly, secured. I want to learn more about UI and Security.</p>
